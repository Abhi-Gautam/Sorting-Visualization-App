	Bubble sort working,
	Adding other algorithms will be easy as all the ground work has been set up.
	Added dropdown menu to select for bar and dots
	Different color palate added for the plot styles.
	Added all the basic sorting algorithms.
	Added a feature to sort colors.
	
	What to do:- 
	Add all the sorting algorithms
	Exception Checks!!
	
    
  When both of them is complete we will think about adding path finding algorithms.

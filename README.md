	What has been done  up until now:-
	• Bubble sort working,
	• Adding other algorithms will be easy as all the ground work has been set up.
	
	
	What to do:-
	• Change the initial speed from 1x to 4x.
	• Remove the app bar feature and add dropdown menu to select for bar and dots. 
	• Different color palate should be added for the bars.
	• Once every sorting algorithm is implemented we will add the feature of dots together with bars.
    
  When both of them is complete we will think about adding path finding algorithms.
